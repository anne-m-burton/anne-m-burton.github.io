#### [Risky Health Behaviors (Undergraduate), The University of Texas at Dallas](https://annemburton.com/pages/teaching/micro_theory_2022f.html)

##### Course Description

This course will teach students the economic approach to studying risky health behaviors. Risky behaviors such as alcohol abuse, tobacco use, drug use, risky sex, poor diet, a sedentary lifestyle (leading to obesity), and self-harm contribute to hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths and billions in medical costs in the U.S. each year. This course will cover the research literature on the economic causes, correlates, and consequences of risky health behaviors. Several policies intended to modify or mitigate risky health behaviors, such as the minimum legal drinking age and tobacco regulation, will be discussed in class.

#### [Intermediate Microeconomic Theory (Undergraduate), The University of Texas at Dallas](https://annemburton.com/pages/teaching/micro_theory_2022f.html)

##### Course Description

This course examines theories of how consumers and producers behave and interact in markets. Topics include consumer preferences, budget constraints, utility maximization, cost minimization, profit maximization, perfect competition, and market power.

#### [Public Economics I (Graduate), The University of Texas at Dallas](https://annemburton.com/pages/teaching/grad_public_i_2022s.html)

##### Course Description

This course is one half of the two-course Economics Ph.D. field sequence in public economics. This course focuses on the expenditure/government program side of public economics; the other course focuses on the revenue/taxation side.

In addition to learning about government programs and the many effects of government interventions in markets, this course is designed to help you transition from being a consumer of research to a producer of research.

A main focus of the course is reading and presenting economics papers on topics in public economics, broadly defined. Major projects include writing referee reports and drafting and presenting a research proposal.
