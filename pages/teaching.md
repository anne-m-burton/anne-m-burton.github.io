##### Course Description

This course examines theories of how consumers and producers behave and interact in markets. Topics include consumer preferences, budget constraints, utility maximization, cost minimization, profit maximization, perfect competition, and market power.

This course is one half of the two-course Economics Ph.D. field sequence in public economics. This course focuses on the expenditure/government program side of public economics; the other course focuses on the revenue/taxation side.

In addition to learning about government programs and the many effects of government interventions in markets, this course is designed to help you transition from being a consumer of research to a producer of research.
