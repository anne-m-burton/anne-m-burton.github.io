##### Course Description

This course is one half of the two-course Economics Ph.D. field sequence in public economics. This course focuses on the expenditure/government program side of public economics; the other course focuses on the revenue/taxation side.

In addition to learning about government programs and the many effects of government interventions in markets, this course is designed to help you transition from being a consumer of research to a producer of research.

A main focus of the course is reading and presenting economics papers on topics in public economics, broadly defined. Major projects include writing referee reports and drafting and presenting a research proposal.
