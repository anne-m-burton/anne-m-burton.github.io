<strong> Acknowledgements: </strong> Thank you Samara Gunter (my undergrad econ of crime professor) for sharing your syllabus and reading list with me. The reading list has changed quite a bit since I took your course over a decade ago because there have been many fantastic papers in the economics of crime literature written in the last decade, but the assessments are timeless. Thank you Evan Riehl for the list of reading questions, which I adapted slightly.

##### Course Description

This course empirically analyzes the causes and consequences of crime and the criminal justice system using the tools of economics. A main focus of the course is reading and discussing empirical research papers in the economics of crime literature. Topics include the effects of incarceration on the incarcerated, the impacts of policies intended to deter crime or reduce recidivism, racial disparities in the criminal justice system, and the causes and consequences of domestic violence. Major projects include creation of a data portfolio examining one of several sources of national crime data using tables, graphs, and statistical relationships and a group presentation on a major episode or issue in U.S. crime policy.
