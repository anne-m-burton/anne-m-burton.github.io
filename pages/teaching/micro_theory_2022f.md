##### Course Description

This course examines theories of how consumers and producers behave and interact in markets. Topics include consumer preferences, budget constraints, utility maximization, cost minimization, profit maximization, perfect competition, and market power. This course uses calculus to solve consumer and producer optimization problems. In doing so students will gain a better understanding of how markets and market participants work, as well as a foundational toolkit for understanding microeconomics.
