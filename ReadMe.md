This is the GitHub repository used to create my academic website. [I created this website using Marisa Carlos's tutorial, which can be found here.](http://marisacarlos.com/pages/create-simple-academic-website)

Her tutorial and website are heavily based on the tutorial and website from [Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org).
